# 1.0 Executive Summary

## 1.1 Overview

Blender Foundation (CLIENT) engaged the Security Assessment Team to conduct penetration testing against the security controls within their web information environment to provide a practical demonstration of those controls' effectiveness, as well as to provide an estimate of their susceptibility to exploitation and/or data breaches.

The test was performed in accordance with industry-standard penetration testing methods. The assessment employed passive reconnaissance and active vulnerability analysis techniques to evaluate network security, encryption implementation, and infrastructure hardening. CLIENT's information environment is protected by enterprise-grade hosting (Cloudflare CDN), modern cryptographic standards, and an active Web Application Firewall (WAF).

---

## 1.2 High-Level Test Outcomes

**External penetration test:** Intended to simulate the network-level actions of a malicious actor targeting publicly accessible assets.

Overall, CLIENT presents a **low-risk attack surface** with excellent foundational security controls. The organization utilizes modern TLS implementation (1.3 + 1.2) with strong cipher suites, A-grade SSL/TLS configurations, and proper DNSSEC enablement. No critical or high-severity vulnerabilities were identified requiring immediate remediation.

However, **three minor configuration gaps** were identified:

1. The web server is missing the **HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)** header.

2. The domain is missing a **Sender Policy Framework (SPF)** email authentication record.

3. The domain is missing a **Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)** record.

---

## 1.3 Overall Risk Rating

Having considered the potential outcomes and the risk levels assessed for each documented testing activity, the Security Assessment Team considers Blender Foundation's overall risk exposure regarding malicious actors' attempts to breach and/or control resources within their information environment to be **LOW**.

---

## 1.4 Prioritized Recommendations

Based on the results achieved during the test project, the following recommendations are presented by order of priority **(Within 30 Days)**:

1. **Implement HSTS Header:** Add `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload` to all HTTPS responses to prevent SSL stripping.

2. **Configure SPF Record:** Add TXT record `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com -all` to reject unauthorized senders.

3. **Configure DMARC Policy:** Add TXT record `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@blender.org` to enforce email authentication.

---

# 2.0 Test Scope and Method

## 2.1 Extent of Testing

Blender Foundation engaged the Security Assessment Team to provide the following penetration testing services:

- Network-level, technical penetration testing against internet-facing hosts.
- Web application security and infrastructure enumeration.
- SSL/TLS implementation and cipher analysis.
- DNS configuration and email infrastructure (MX records) security analysis.

**Out of Scope:** Active system exploitation, internal network access, social engineering/phishing, and Denial of Service testing.

---

## 2.2 Test Scope Summary

The following information environment zones were included in the scope of the penetration test:

- **External Network:** www.blender.org public web infrastructure and associated public subdomains.

The test was conducted in the following phase:

- **External Stage:** Starting from the internet. Intended to simulate the actions of a malicious actor interacting with externally accessible assets.

---

# 3.0 External Phase

## 3.1 Phase Summary

The external phase of the pentest focused on the assets which are publicly accessible. Reconnaissance and scanning were conducted to identify opportunities for intrusion or malicious modification of the systems. Attacks were simulated from external networks to the externally accessible assets at CLIENT using tools such as Nmap, whatweb, wafw00f, and theHarvester.

---

## 3.2 Actions Taken

To determine the risk level of CLIENT's externally accessible hosts and servers, the analyst conducted internet-level scanning and analysis.

**From Zone:** Internet  
**Via:** N/A  
**To Zone:** External Network  
**Method:** Internet penetration testing

---

### Current Zone Activities:

**Target:** www.blender.org (172.66.172.236, 104.20.41.146)

---

#### HSTS is not enforced (Low Severity)

The application fails to prevent users from connecting to it over unencrypted connections. This opens the possibility of man-in-the-middle attacks performed on the site by users who visit unencrypted links. To remedy this, add a response header with the name "Strict-Transport-Security" with an acceptable max-age expiration time.

---

#### Missing SPF and DMARC Records (Low Severity)

No SPF or DMARC TXT records are configured for blender.org. Without these records, unauthorized mail servers may send email appearing to originate from @blender.org, and there is no enforcement policy for email authentication.

#### Nmap Scan Report for blender.org:

Host is up. All non-essential ports (SSH, MySQL, etc.) are properly filtered.

| PORT | STATE | SERVICE |
|------|-------|---------|
| 80/tcp | open | http (Redirects to HTTPS) |
| 443/tcp | open | https |

#### SSL/TLS Certificate and Ciphers:

**Subject:** *.blender.org (Wildcard)  
**Issuer:** Let's Encrypt  
**Valid Until:** March 27, 2026  
**Signature:** SHA-256 with RSA  

**TLS 1.3:** Supported (3 strong ciphers)  
**TLS 1.2:** Supported (14 strong ciphers)  

No weak ciphers detected. Perfect Forward Secrecy enabled (x25519 ECDHE).

# 4.0 Conclusions

## 4.1 Most Likely Compromise Scenarios

Because CLIENT's external web infrastructure is highly secured and actively protected by a Web Application Firewall, direct exploitation of the web application is unlikely. An attacker would most likely attempt to leverage the missing email authentication records (SPF/DMARC) to conduct spoofed phishing campaigns against CLIENT's users or partners. Additionally, if users connect from unsecured public networks, an attacker could attempt an SSL stripping (Man-in-the-Middle) attack due to the absence of an enforced HSTS header.

---

## 4.2 Implications

Based on the above testing activities, the average risk level across the board is **LOW**.

The organization employs enterprise-grade hosting, modern cryptographic standards, active WAF protection, and current software versions. System hardening and configuration updates should be implemented within 30 days to close the minor configuration gaps. Enforcing strict HSTS and proper email validation (SPF/DMARC) will bring the security posture fully in line with industry best practices and mitigate the most likely compromise scenarios.
